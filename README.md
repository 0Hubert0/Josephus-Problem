# Josephus-Problem

A program visualising the Josephus Problem (Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem) represented as a group of students from which one is supposed to get a prize. Every other step, one is out of the competition. The last one wins.

In the program a user can set the amount of students(1-168) and the step(numerical) counting the next person to be eliminated from the pool. Everything is animated.
